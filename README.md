## **Problem Statement**
Freelancing platforms today face significant trust deficits:
1. **Mismatched Expectations**: Clients and freelancers often disagree on whether the delivered work meets the job description (JD).
2. **Dispute Escalations**: Without transparent and impartial dispute resolution systems, conflicts frequently arise.
3. **Payment Risks**: Freelancers may not receive payments for completed work, and clients risk paying for subpar deliverables.
4. **Validator Credibility**: Many platforms lack mechanisms to verify the expertise and professionalism of arbitrators resolving disputes.

These issues reduce user confidence and hinder the growth of freelancing platforms.

## **Solution**
TrustGigz addresses these challenges through a structured and decentralized approach:

1. **Attestation-Based Agreements**:
   - When a freelancer applies and is selected for a job, an **attestation** is created on the blockchain using tools like BAS.
   - This attestation immutably records the agreed job description, deliverables, and payment terms.

2. **AI-Powered Work Validation**:
   - Freelancers submit their work with a demo video.
   - The submission is analyzed by an **AI agent** to generate a **relevance score**, objectively comparing it to the JD.

3. **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**:
   - In case of disputes, verified **validators**—subject matter experts who prove their credentials (e.g., Fiverr transaction history)—analyze the context and submission.
   - The dispute outcome is determined by a **weighted average** of validator votes and the AI relevance score.

4. **Escrow-Based Payments**:
   - Clients stake the agreed payment in an escrow contract when creating a job.
   - Funds are released to freelancers only after successful completion or dispute resolution
